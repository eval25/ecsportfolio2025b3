  <h3>Timeline</h3> 
<p>I started playing soccer when I was 5 years old, and quickly loved it. I first started playing on recreation teams and played on those for about 6-7 years. In 7th grade I moved to competition and I loved my new teammates and was on a fun team. After playing on that team for 3 years I started plaing my freshman highschool seanson and still have another 3 years to complate my highschool season!  </p>
 <h3>Highlights</h3>
<p>The sport soccer has many fun elements that I enjoy. This includes: </p>
 <ul>team
  friends
  games
   activities
  competition
new moves</ul>
<p> This sport is very fun and I have loved plaing it for a long time, I hope to play this forever and keep the friends from it.</p>
