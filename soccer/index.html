  <h3>Soccer</h3>
	  <p>I started playing soccer when I was 5 years old, and quickly loved it. I first started playing on recreation teams and played on those for about 6-7 years. In 7th grade I moved to competition and I loved my new teammates and was on a fun team. After playing on that team for 3 years I started plaing my freshman highschool seanson and still have another 3 years to complate my highschool season!  </p>
